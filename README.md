# Techworld

Techworld is an ecommerce website built with Next.js. The UI is designed with TailwindCSS and the Framer Motion library is used for animating route changes. User authentication is handled by Magic and payments are processed using Stripe.

The backend part of the website uses Strapi as a headless CMS and is deployed on Heroku. Admins can upload different products using the Strapi admin panel. Media files are uploaded on Cloudinary, which is linked to Strapi in the backend.
